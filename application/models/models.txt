Immutable models that should not be adjusted:
- Wonder (manage.create_db calls cards_setup)
- Card (manage.create_db calls cards_setup)

Immutable from in-game's perspective after setup:
- User (created by authentication process)
- Game (created by application.app.create_game())

Mutable from in-game:
- Player (created by application.app.create_game())
Player stores all current state information for a player
- Round
Round stores hand information. When searched by a round, age and player, it will return that player's hand
- Cardhist
Stores how cards have been played so far. Searching this table by player will return all cards played.
Specify not discarded to avoid discard pile. Search by discarded for every player to return discard pile.
Does not include cards that are used for wonder construction - the wonder cards will be in here instead.
